# Alva Clean CRM System Prototype (Microservices arhitecture)

Splitting a monolith into microservices with best practices for development.

Monolith Main Project: https://github.com/ArturDavidenko/CRMAlvaClean

# Development plan:

### Migration from Monolith to Microservices

# 1. Analysis & Preparation

 Analyze the current monolithic codebase: API endpoints, modules, dependencies.

 Define clear domain boundaries: Auth, Employee, Customer, Order.

 Identify common functionality to be extracted into shared libraries (models, DTOs, utilities).

 Monorepo decision:
- All microservices, frontend, and infrastructure configurations will be stored in a single repository.

# 2. Architectural Design

 Design Clean Architecture for each service:

  Auth Service (JWT, Refresh Tokens, Role-based access control).
  
  - Employee Service.
  
  - Customer Service.
  
  - Order Service.
  
  - GraphQL Gateway (facade).
  
   Define inter-service communication patterns using RabbitMQ.
  
   Plan database abstraction to allow multiple database support (primary: MongoDB).
  
   Design logging and monitoring with ELK Stack (ElasticSearch, Logstash/Filebeat, Kibana).
  
   Define Kubernetes deployment strategy (Helm charts per service).

# 3. Infrastructure & CI/CD

 Configure monorepo structure and tooling.

 Create Dockerfile for each microservice.

 Prepare docker-compose for local development.

 Create Helm charts for Kubernetes deployments.

 Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline:

  - Code linting & formatting checks.
  
  - Build & push Docker images to registry.
  
  - Deploy to local Kubernetes (minikube/kind).
  
  - Deploy to staging/production environments.


# 4. Microservices Implementation

Auth Service

 - User registration & authentication.

 - JWT & refresh token management.

 - Role-based access control.

Employee Service

 - CRUD operations for employees.

 - Integration with Auth Service for authentication.

Customer Service

 - CRUD operations for customers.

 - Search & filtering features.

Order Service

 - Order creation & management.

 - RabbitMQ integration with Employee/Customer Service.

GraphQL Gateway

 - Aggregate APIs from all services.

 - Optimize queries and responses.


# 5. Frontend (Angular + TypeScript)

 Initialize Angular workspace.

 Create modules for each domain service.

 Implement authentication and routing.

 Integrate with GraphQL Gateway.

 Add CI/CD pipeline for frontend.

# 6. RabbitMQ & ELK Integration

 Configure RabbitMQ for asynchronous inter-service communication.

 Implement logging to ElasticSearch.

 Configure Kibana dashboards.

 Set up Filebeat/Logstash for log collection.


# 7. Load Testing

 Choose a tool (Locust, JMeter, k6).

 Simulate realistic load (~10,000 users/minute).

 Optimize microservices based on test results.


# 8. Deployment

 Local deployment to Kubernetes (minikube/kind).

 Staging environment setup.

 Optional cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure, or others).


# 9. Documentation

 README for each microservice.

 API documentation (Swagger for REST, GraphQL schema).

 Local development setup guide.

 CI/CD pipelines documentation.


# 10. Maintenance & Monitoring

 Set up service metrics monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana).

 Configure alerting for critical issues.

 Continuous refactoring & optimization.

### Important note

This plan is not final and may be updated or adjusted during development.
Technologies mentioned in this document can also be slightly changed if better solutions are found during implementation.
