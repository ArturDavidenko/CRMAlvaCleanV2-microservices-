# AlvaCleanCRM 🏢✨
*CRM prototype system with microservice architecture*

---

## 🎯 Main Goal of the Project
AlvaCleanCRM is created not just as a working application, but as a **platform to demonstrate engineering and architectural thinking**.  
The goal of the project is to show that I can **think like an architect, not just write code**.  

The project is being developed **for a real company**, where the number of employees and processes is limited, but the system is designed with **possible high load** and future scaling in mind.  

This serves as:  
- a training ground to hone development skills;  
- a demonstration of architectural approach and enterprise practices;  
- a real working project that can be expanded to meet business needs.

## 🏗 Background
During my internship at **SEB (S&B Bank)**, I had the opportunity to observe the entire process of a large enterprise project:  
- from task management in **Jira**;  
- to maintaining documentation in **Confluence**;  
- to configuring **CI/CD pipelines**, Kubernetes, and various environments: `a-environment`, `development-environment`, and in the future — `live-environment`.

This inspired me to create a **system as close as possible to an Enterprise approach**, where every element reflects real industry practices.
